<p>The <strong>boolean type</strong> in Python is called <code>bool</code> and has exactly two possible values: <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> (with a capital "T" and "F"). As these are keywords in Python, this means it is not possible to redefine them or use them as variable names.</p>

<h2>Creating Boolean Values</h2>

<p>You can create boolean variables by directly assigning <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>:</p>

<py-cell>flag = True
active = False

print(flag)
print(active)
</py-cell>
